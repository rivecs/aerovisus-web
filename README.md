A public wrapper for the official website for AeroVisus, a visual media and aerial services brand focused on drone photography, video, and modern digital presentation.

This is a production site built to showcase services, establish credibility, and provide a clean foundation for future expansion. It was designed with performance, clarity, and maintainability in mind rather than flash or overengineering.

## What this site does

- Presents AeroVisus services and capabilities
- Acts as a professional portfolio and brand presence
- Supports marketing, outreach, and client trust
- Provides a flexible structure for adding new content over time

## Tech Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (global styles with page-specific additions)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Lightweight client-side logic for navigation and interaction

## Design approach

- Minimalist layout that keeps attention on imagery
- Clean typography and spacing
- Intentional restraint with animation and effects
- Mobile-first responsiveness

Visual work should speak for itself. The site stays out of its own way.
